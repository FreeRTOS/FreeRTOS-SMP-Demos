Prerequisites:

  - XMOS xTIMEcomposer 15.0.6 is required to build the demo. Earlier and later
    versions may work but have not been tested.

  - GNU Make. A makefile is included to build this application, which requires
    that make be on the path. On Windows this may require building in a bash
    terminal, rather than in the Windows command prompt.

  - The demo runs on the xcore.ai Explorer board.

  - Plug the xTAG programmer into the evaluation board. Ensure both the xTAG
    and evaluation board are connected to the computer via USB.

To build and run the demo:

  - cd into the RTOSDemo directory
  - Build the demo by running `make'
  - Run the demo with `make run'
