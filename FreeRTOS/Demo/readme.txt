Each RTOS port has a demo application to demonstrate it's use.

+ The Demo/Common directory contains the demo application files as described on 
the http://www.FreeRTOS.org WEB site.  Each file creates one or more tasks.
The files in the Demo/Common directory are used by every demo application for
every port.

+ All the other directories contain a project or makefile for the demo
application targeted at a particular microcontroller.
