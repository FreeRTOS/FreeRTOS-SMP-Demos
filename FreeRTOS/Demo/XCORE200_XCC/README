Prerequisites:

  - XMOS xTIMEcomposer 14.4.1 is required to build the demo. Earlier versions
    may work but have not been tested.

  - The demo runs on the xCORE microphone array evaluation board which can be
    purchased here:

  - Plug the xTAG programmer into the evaluation board. Ensure both the xTAG
    and evaluation board are connected to the computer via USB.

To build and run the demo:

With the xTIMEcomposer IDE:

  - Create a workspace in this directory (FreeRTOS/Demo/XCORE200_XCC)
  - Import the 5 projects (RTOSDemo, lib_rtos_support, lib_trycatch,
    lib_xassert, lib_xcore_c).
  - Build the RTOSDemo project.
  - Create a run configuration for the resulting RTOSDemo/bin/RTOSDemo.xe
    binary. Make sure xSCOPE Target I/O option is selected.

From the command line:

  - cd into the RTOSDemo directory
  - Build the demo by running `xmake'
  - Run the demo with `xrun --xscope bin/RTOSDemo.xe'
